### About
⭐ I fell into coding around 2013, firstly to make a Raspberry Pi run my greenhouse.
After that I discovered Flask-SQLAlchemy.  

Then I was stuck not knowing how to properly host and secure my systems!  

So that came next. A bit of time passed as I worked in IT Support.

Triangle rotate, and I went through the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path, and the Python, PHP courses, etc etc.  

My time is spent learning best practices, checking and testing different stuff, and coding up my dream apps.

Of course, it could be better spent with *more* testing, *more* uploading to GitHub, and *more* social networking!
