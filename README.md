### About
⭐ I fell into coding around 2013, firstly to make a Raspberry Pi run my greenhouse.
After that I discovered Flask-SQLAlchemy. 

But I was stuck not knowing how to properly host and secure my systems! So that came next.

⏳ A bit of time passed as I worked in IT Support.

Then I got back into coding through a traineeship that put me through Full Stack Engineer, Python, PHP, etc Codecademy courses. ✅  
See the source for [Gazetteer](https://github.com/interplexed/Gazetteer) and [Company Directory](https://github.com/interplexed/Company-Directory).  

📢 These days, my coding projects are fairly complicated; I have high standards and *really* enjoy the challenges.  

My time is spent learning best practices, checking and testing different stuff, and coding up my dream apps.
Of course, it could be better spent with *more* testing, *more* uploading to GitHub, and *more* social networking!

💜 Thanks for looking, reach out via my [website](https://lewiscooper.dev)!
